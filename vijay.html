    Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamaanavale.[10][11] The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three were box office successes;[12] barring successful ventures Thamizhan,[12] Youth and Bagavathi (all three released in 2002),[13][14] his subsequent films Vaseegara and Pudhiya Geethai were released. While Vaseegara was a moderate success and received praise for his comic-timing,[15] Puthiya Geethai received negative reviews and underperformed at the box office.[16][17][18] The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003),[19] changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero.[20] He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year.[4][21] His performance as a sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.[22][23] He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007).[24][25] Barring Vettaikaaran and Kuruvi's box office successes,[26] his subsequent releases Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career,[citation needed] and Villu (2009) were average successes;[27][28][29] his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.[30]

In 2011 Vijay's career prospects improved after he was praised for his role as a bodyguard in Kaavalan, which had a 100-day theatrical run and was a box office hit.[31][32] Velayudham in which, he appeared as a masked superhero was commercially successful worldwide.[citation needed] The following year he appeared in two films: as a college student in Nanban and an army officer in Thuppakki.[33][34] His performances in both films received positive critical feedback.[35] He followed that with Thalaivaa (2013) and the multi-starrer Jilla (2014) which was commercially successful.[36][37] He teamed up with Murugadoss again for the action film Kaththi (2014). The film, which had Vijay playing dual roles as a thief and an idealist, became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of that year; his performances earned him critics praise.[38] In his next film, fantasy Puli (2015), he featured again in dual roles;[39] it was an overseas success.[citation needed] The following year, he played a police officer in Atlee's Theri to mixed reviews.[40] The film had one of the biggest openings in Tamil cinema and was a major commercial success.[41][42] Vijay's performance won him South Indian International Movie Awards.[43][44] He played triple roles for the first time in Mersal (2017).[45] In addition to garnering a UK Award for Best Actor,[46][47] the film became a box office success.[48] Vijay earned critical acclaim for Sarkar (2018).[49][50] He also starred in films Bigil (2019), Master (2021), Beast (2022), Varisu, Leo (both 2023) and He played a four roles in The Greatest of All Time (2024), all of which garnered mixed reviews but were commercially successful in the box office, with Leo becoming the highest-grossing film of his career.[51][52]
